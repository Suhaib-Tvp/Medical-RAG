        "\t* Physical activity: Regular aerobic exercise such as walking, cycling, or swimming (150 min/week) including resistance and balance exercises.\n"
        "\t* Diet: Heart-healthy diet (DASH or Mediterranean), rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins; limit salt, saturated fats, and refined sugars.\n"
        "\t* Weight management: Achieve and maintain healthy weight to reduce blood pressure.\n"
        "\t* Smoking cessation: Quit smoking and avoid secondhand smoke.\n\n"
        "2. **Stress and Sleep Management**:\n"
        "\t* Stress reduction: Meditation, yoga, tai chi, deep breathing.\n"
        "\t* Sleep hygiene: Consistent sleep schedule, 7â€“8 hours per night, relaxing environment.\n\n"
        "3. **Monitoring and Managing Comorbidities**:\n"
        "\t* Regular monitoring: Blood pressure, glucose, lipids.\n"
        "\t* Collaborative care: Manage cardiovascular comorbidities with healthcare providers.\n\n"
        "4. **Alternative and Complementary Therapies**:\n"
        "\t* Acupuncture, acupressure, relaxation therapies.\n\n"
        "5. **Social Support and Education**:\n"
        "\t* Patient education: Self-monitoring, lifestyle adherence.\n"
        "\t* Social support: Family, support groups, community programs.\n\n"
        "6. **Multidisciplinary Care**:\n"
        "\t* Engage primary care, cardiologists, dietitians, nurses for collaborative management.\n"
        "\t* Ensure regular follow-ups and adjustment of interventions as needed.\n\n"
        "By implementing these interventions, elderly patients with Hypertension and cardiovascular comorbidities can improve blood pressure control, "
